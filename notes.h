/**
 * Class Notes:
 *
 * For projects, the key ideas are for:
 * Comments for others to understand, don't provide unnecessary comments
 * Make sure the organization of the project is clean
 * Make sure your code compiles and is working
 * Make sure it is correct syntax and it is easily readable
 * Add as little comments as possible
 * Make sure the code is efficient (don't make it a linear search when you can simplify it to binary search)
